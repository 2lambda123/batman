batman: |br| Bad-Ass Transit Model cAlculatioN
=========================================

The ``batman`` package for Python makes super fast calculation of transit light curves easy.  

The package supports quadratic and nonlinear limb-darkening, as well as custom user-specified profiles. The lionâ€™s share of the computation is done with C extension modules, so it is very fast. ``batman`` is parallelized with OpenMP and compatible with Python 2-3.
