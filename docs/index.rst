batman: Bad-Ass Transit Model cAlculatioN in Python
===================================================

The ``batman`` package for Python provides fast, flexible calculation of exoplanet transit light curves.  The package includes analytic calculation of light curves for quadratic limb darkening (based on Mandel & Agol 2002), as well as a brute-force integration scheme for nonlinear limb darkening (as described in Kreidberg 2015, arXiv:NNNN:NNNN).
